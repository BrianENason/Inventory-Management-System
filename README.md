# Inventory-Management-System

This project is in answer to the following prompt:

" You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system.
Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions,
deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated
inventory program.
You have been provided with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the
system and a class diagram to assist you in your work. The organization also has specific business requirements that must be
considered for the application. A systems analyst created the solution statements outlined in the
requirements section of this task based on the business requirements. You will use these solution statements
to develop your application. "

This is an Inventory Management System that allows the user to update, create, edit, and delete in-house, outsourced, and packaged products for ease of record keeping. It uses JavaFX and SceneBuilder for the GUI and Java language for the "backend" code.

It also has been documented with JavaDocs (folder in the Repo).
